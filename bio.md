Name: Andrew Weckwerth

From: Minneapolis, MN is where I live, but my home is a quiet campsite in the
late evening

Hobbies: Running (especially trails), canoeing (BWCAW if possible), reading
(fiction), home brewing, gardening

Professional backgound: I graduated in 2012 from Luther College with a degree
in biology and political science. After a term with AmeriCorps working to help
a community realize residential energy efficiency, I moved with my wife to
Minneapolis/St. Paul and started work as a Risk Assessment Facilitator at 3M
while I looked for options in my original academic areas. I eventually arrived
at the conclusion that the most effective career step would be to gain general
technological competency.

Programming Background:
-I did a limited amount of programming in python and R in the course of my
undergrad biology degree, but these programs were mostly based on templates.
-After deciding on the OSU program, I got my first real programming
introduction during 161/162. I forged along through 161, but started to feel
more confident in 162. Finishing the final for each class felt really
rewarding.
