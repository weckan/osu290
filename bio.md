Name: Andrew Weckwerth

From: Minneapolis, MN

Hobbies: Running (especially trails), canoeing (BWCAW if possible), reading
(fiction), home brewing, gardening

Professional backgound: I graduated in 2012 from Luther College with a degree
in biology and political science. After a term with AmeriCorps working to help
a community realize residential energy efficiency, I moved with my wife to
Minneapolis/St. Paul and started work as a Risk Assessment Facilitator at 3M
while I looked for options in my original academic areas. I eventually arrived
at the conclusion that the most effective career step would be to gain general
technological competency.
