Programming Background:
-I did a limited amount of programming in python and R in the course of my
undergrad biology degree, but these programs were mostly based on templates.
-After deciding on the OSU program, I got my first real programming
introduction during 161/162. I forged along through 161, but started to feel
more confident in 162. Finishing the final for each class felt really
rewarding.
